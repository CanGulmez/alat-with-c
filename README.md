# ALAT: Advanced Linear Algebra Toolkit with C programming

ALAT project was developed for calculating linear algebratic problems automatically. 
Especially, in engineering and science, linear algebratic problems are so hot topic.
So, I've decided to write this project.

Of course, I may have made mistake in some methods. Please, contact the with me over my e-mail address.

## Features

I've seperated this project into 4 parts mainly. First is `Matrices` class which contain 
the methods related to matrix operations. Second is `Vectors` class which contain the 
methods about vector operations. Third is `Apps` class which contain the common applications 
related with linear algebra. Fourth is `Crypts` which provide the cryptography operations.
